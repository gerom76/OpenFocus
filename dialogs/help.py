    <p>Guided Filter<br/>
    Guided-filter fusion tuned for practical edge preservation. Ideal for simpler scenes or moderate focus variations, and you can fine-tune the kernel slider to balance sharpness and smoothness.</p>

    <p>DCT<br/>
    Frequency-domain fusion that evaluates block-wise DCT variance and keeps the sharpest contributor per region. It is fast, fully CPU-based, and works well when you need crisp edges without deploying neural models.</p>

    <p>DTCWT<br/>
    Dual-tree complex wavelet fusion that decomposes the stack across scales and orientations before recombining it. It is well suited to intricate, high-frequency content where retaining fine detail is critical.</p>

    <p>GFG-FGF<br/>
    GFG-FGF is a multi-focus image fusion algorithm based on a generalized four-neighborhood Gaussian gradient (GFG) operator combined with a fast guided filter (FGF). Feature extraction uses the GFG operator to capture high-frequency edge and gradient information. Information enhancement leverages the FGF together with the original image texture to smooth defocused regions while emphasizing focused areas. The fusion strategy constructs a pixel-wise decision map by selecting the maximum focus measure per pixel and then refines these decisions with FGF for edge-preserving smoothing, producing a weighted fusion that favors sharp, well-focused pixels.</p>

    <p>StackMFF-V4<br/>
    A neural network trained on everyday focus stacks. It generally produces the strongest results with minimal tuning. Because it is not fine-tuned for specialist domains (microphotography, microscopy, medical imaging, etc.), avoid it when domain shifts are expected. Runs fastest with GPU acceleration.</p>"""

    <p>Align (Homography)<br/>
    Uses feature-based homography transformation to align images. Detects SIFT features between consecutive frames and computes perspective transformation matrices. Ideal for most focus stacks that need global geometric correction.</p>

    <p>Align (ECC)<br/>
    Enhanced Correlation Coefficient alignment refines alignment at the sub-pixel level. Works well for fine adjustments or whenever feature detection is unreliable.</p>

    <p>Both options are independent—enable either one individually or turn on both to apply homography alignment first and then refine with ECC.</p>"""
