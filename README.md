## 🔭 Overview
OpenFocus is a PyQt6-based multi-focus registration and fusion workstation that delivers commercial-grade alignment and blending results. The project is fully open source (MIT License) and runs on CPU by default with optional GPU acceleration for the StackMFF V4 neural model.

## ✨ Highlights
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Plug-and-play workflows with unapologetically simple, guided operations.
- **Flexible Processing Flows**: Run fusion-only, registration-only, or combined registration + fusion pipelines depending on your workload.
- **Batch Automation**: Kick off batch jobs across multiple folders with live progress, cancellation, and automatic output organization.
- **Annotation & Export Toolkit**: Overlay labels, export GIF animations, and save processed stacks in JPG/PNG/BMP/TIFF with consistent metadata handling.
- **AI-Assisted Fusion**: Ship with StackMFF V4 to unlock deep-learning-quality fusion alongside classic signal-processing methods.

## 🧪 Algorithms
### Fusion Algorithms

- **Guided Filter**: Fast edge-preserving fusion that enhances contrast while suppressing noise.
- **DCT Multi-Focus Fusion**: Frequency-domain technique optimized for crisp detail recovery.
- **Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT)**: Multi-scale representation that preserves fine texture structures.
- **GFG-FGF**: GFG-FGF is based on a generalized four-neighborhood Gaussian gradient (GFG) operator combined with a fast guided filter (FGF). 
- **StackMFF V4**: Pretrained deep model delivering state-of-the-art focus stacking quality.

### Registration Algorithms
- **Homography**: Performs feature-based projective alignment using keypoint matching and RANSAC to handle global perspective transformations.
- **ECC**: Performs intensity-based alignment by maximizing the enhanced correlation coefficient for precise, sub-pixel registration.
  
> **License Notice:** Every fusion/registration algorithm included comes from open-source research implementations. When using or redistributing them, please follow each algorithm’s original license terms in addition to the OpenFocus MIT license.
